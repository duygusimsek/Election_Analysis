# Election_Analysis

## Overview

### History of the Project

In the previous project, the election audit analysis of a recent local congressional election had been completed.  To analyze the election data programmatically Python programming language (Python 3.10.2) and  Visual Studio development environment (Visual Studio Code, 1.65.2) had used and with the created code:

* The total number of votes cast was calculated.
* A complete list of the candidate for the election was created.
* The total number of votes that each candidate received was calculated.
* For each candidate, the percentage distribution of votes was calculated.
* Based on the highest vote the winner of the election was determined.
